                <p>Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman FRS (7 November 1888 â€“ 21 November 1970) was an Indian physicist known mainly for his work in the field of light scattering. With his student K. S. Krishnan, he discovered that when light traverses a transparent material, some of the deflected light changes their paths (wavelength and amplitude). This phenomenon was a hitherto unknown type of scattering of light and was subsequently termed as the Raman effect or Raman scattering. Raman received the 1930 Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery and was the first Asian to receive a Nobel Prize in any branch of science.</p>

                <li><span>In 1930,</span> he won the Nobel Prize in Physics "for his work on the scattering of light and for the discovery of the effect named after him." He was the first Asian and first non-white to receive any Nobel Prize in the sciences. Before him, Rabindranath Tagore (also Indian) had received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1913.</li>
